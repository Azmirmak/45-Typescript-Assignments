// Assignment #45 : Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

 function carsInfo(carManufacturer: string, model: string, ...features: any){
     let info: {[key :string]: string}= {
         Manufacturer : carManufacturer,
         Model : model,
     };
     features.forEach((feature: string) => {
         let [key, value] = feature.split(":");
         info[key.trim()] = value.trim();
     });
     return info;
 }
let car = carsInfo("Honda", "Accord", "Color: Matt Black", "Type : Sedan");
console.log(car);
