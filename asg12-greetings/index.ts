//Assignment #12 : Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Names = ["Abdullah", "Sheikh", "Noman", "Hamza"];

console.log(`How are you ${Names[0]} ?`);
console.log(`How are you ${Names[1]} ?`);
console.log(`How are you ${Names[2]} ?`);
console.log(`How are you ${Names[3]} ?`);
