// Assignment #34: Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.


let pizzas = ["Pepperoni", "Fantom", "Tikka"];

for (let i=0; i<pizzas.length; i++ ){
    console.log(`I like ${pizzas[i]} pizza`);
}

console.log("Pepperoni pizza is an all-time favorite among pizza lovers, and its allure lies in its perfect balance of flavors. The spicy and slightly smoky taste of pepperoni complements the creamy, melting goodness of mozzarella, while the tangy tomato sauce adds a refreshing counterpoint. I really love pizza!")
